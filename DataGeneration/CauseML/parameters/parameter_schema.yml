SCHEMA:
  POTENTIAL_CONFOUNDER_SELECTION_PROBABILITY:
    type: number
    <<: *probability_min_max
    description: |
        Marginal probability that each covariate is a potential confounder
        (affecting one or both of treatment and outcome) Lower values reduce
        the number of covariates which are predicitive of treatment/outcome.
        This makes modelling harder given need for variable selection

  ACTUAL_CONFOUNDER_ALIGNMENT:
    type: number
    <<: *probability_min_max
    description: |
        Marginal probability that a covariate in the transformed covariate space
        will appear in both the outcome and treatment functions. This is a soft
        target - there is variance in actual achieved alignment.

  ### SHARED TREAT/OUTCOME FUNCTION SETTINGS ###

  TREAT_MECHANISM_COVARIATE_SELECTION_PROBABILITY:
    type: dictionary
    <<: *function_surface_required_keys
    description: |
      Probabilities that govern the probability with which
      covariates appear in the treatment mechanism in different
      forms.

  OUTCOME_MECHANISM_COVARIATE_SELECTION_PROBABILITY:
    type: dictionary
    <<: *function_surface_required_keys
    description: |
      Probabilities that govern the probability with which
      covariates appear in the outcome mechanism in different
      forms.

  OUTCOME_MECHANISM_EXPONENTIATION:
    type: bool
    description: |
      Exponentiate the combined, transformed covariates.

  SUBFUNCTION_CONSTANT_TAIL_THICKNESS:
    type: number
    <<: *dof_min_max
    description: |
      DF for the T-distribution over subfunction constants.

  ### TREATMENT FUNCTION PARAMS ###

      Target propensity score for treatment mechanism

  FORCED_IMBALANCE_ADJUSTMENT:
    type: number
    min: 0
    max: 0.5
    description: |
      Value between 0 and 0.5 which is the proportion of controls/treated units
      that will be swapped to increase imbalance.

  TARGET_MIN_LOGIT:
    type: calculated
    expr: np.log(MIN_PROPENSITY_SCORE/(1-MIN_PROPENSITY_SCORE))
    description: |
      Minimum logit value for treatment mechanism

  TARGET_MAX_LOGIT:
    type: calculated
    expr: np.log(MAX_PROPENSITY_SCORE/(1-MAX_PROPENSITY_SCORE))
    description: |

  ### OUTCOME FUNCTION PARAMS ###

  OUTCOME_NOISE_TAIL_THICKNESS:
    type: number
    <<: *dof_min_max
    description: |

  ### TREATMENT EFFECT PARAMS ###

  TREATMENT_EFFECT_HETEROGENEITY:
    type: number
    <<: *probability_min_max
    description: |
      Marginal probability that there is an interaction between the
      base treatment effect and each subfunction in the outcome function.

  TREATMENT_EFFECT_TAIL_THICKNESS:
    type: number
    <<: *dof_min_max
    description: |

    <<: *probability_min_max
    description: |
      Marginal probability of observing any given row of the dataset.
      Used to reduce the overall number of observations if desired.
