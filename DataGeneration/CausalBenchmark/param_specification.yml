POTENTIAL_CONFOUNDER_SELECTION_PROBABILITY:
  type: number
  min: 0
  max: 1
  description: |
      Marginal probability that each covariate is a potential confounder
      (affecting one or both of treatment and outcome) Lower values reduce
      the number of covariates which are predicitive of treatment/outcome.
      This makes modelling harder given need for variable selection

ACTUAL_CONFOUNDER_ALIGNMENT:
  type: number
  min: 0
  max: 1
  description: |
      Marginal probability that a covariate in the transformed covariate space
      will appear in both the outcome and treatment functions. This is a soft
      target - there is variance in actual achieved alignment.
