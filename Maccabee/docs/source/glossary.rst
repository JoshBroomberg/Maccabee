    Causal Model
      A causal model is the maccabee representation of a mathematical estimator which produces an estimate of one or more causal estimands using data from an observational data set.

    Data Metric
      Data Metrics are real-valued functions that measure a distributional property of a generated data set. Each data metric measures the approximate position of the data set along some well-defined :term:`axis <Distributional Problem Space Axis>` of the distributional problem space. Each axis may have more than one corresponding data metric.

    DGP
      A Data Generating Process describes the mathematical process which gives rise to a set of observed data - covariates, treatment assignments, and outcomes - and the corresponding unobserved/oracle data, primarily the treatment effect.

      Concretely, a DGP relates the DGP Variables - defined in the constants group :class:`~maccabee.constants.Constants.DGPVariables` - through a series of stochastic/deterministic functions. The nature of these functions defines the location of the resultant data sets in the :term:`distributional problem space`.

    Distributional Problem Space
      The performance of causal estimators depends on distributional properties of the observed data. The space of all possible distributional properties forms the distributional problem space. The performance of an estimator across the space and in specific regions is of interest to researchers.

    Distributional Problem Space Axis
      The :term:`distributional problem space` is defined by axes which represent the distributional properties and the values they can take on. The cartesian product of the values the axes can take out is the extent of the problem space.

    Distributional Setting
      A distributional setting refers to a location in the :term:`distributional problem space` characterized by a specific position along each :term:`distributional problem space axis`. Each sampled data generating process has a specific distributional setting which characterizes the data that is generated by it.

    DSL
      A domain specific language is a specific, limited syntax used to define or describe a specialized process. In Maccabee, a simple DSL is used to specify the execution order and dependencies of the data generating functions which make up a data generating process class/instance.

    DGP Variable
      DGP variables are the variables over which the DGP is defined. See chapter 3 and 4 of the theory work.

    Observable DGP Variable
      DGP variables which are available for causal inference.

    Oracle DGP Variable
      DGP variables which are not available for causal inference but which can be thought of as 'existing' during the data generation process. This includes potential outcomes, treatment effect, outcome noise etc.

    Parameter Specification File
      A file used to specify a set of DGP sampling parameters. The specification conforms to the schema laid out in the :term:`parameter schema file`.

    Default Parameter Specification File
      The file which specifies the default set of DGP sampling parameters. This is laid out as a standard :term:`parameter specification file`.

    Parameter Schema File
      The file which defines all of the DGP sampling parameters by providing names, types, validity conditions, and descriptions. The :term:`parameter specification file` specifies DGP sampling parameters that conform to the schema laid out in this file.

    Performance Metric
      Performance Metrics are real-valued functions which measure the quality of a causal estimator by comparing the estimand value to the ground truth. A performance metric may be well defined for a single estimand value but typically, in the context of this package, they are defined over a sample of estimand values with each estimand value corresponding to an estimate of the causal effect/s in a generated data set.

    Transformed Covariate
      Maccabee's sampled treatment and outcome functions are from the class of generalized, additive functions. This means they are comprised of a sum of nonlinear terms, each of which may comprise one or more observed covariates. The value of each of these terms can be thought of as the covariates that are the input of strictly linear treatment/outcome function. These values are thus referred to as the transformed covariates. Many of the data metrics are defined over these transformed covariates as this definition is a useful way to measure aspects of the sampled functions while controling for the effect of the functional form of the terms. See the :download:`theory paper </maccabee-theory-paper.pdf>` for more on the transformed covariates.

    YML
      YAML is a human-readable data-serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted (Wikipedia).
