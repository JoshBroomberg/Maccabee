Maccabee
========

Maccabee provides a new mechanism for benchmarking causal inference methods. This method uses sampled Data Generating Processes defined over empirical covariates to provide more realistic, less biased evaluation of estimator performance across the distributional problem space of causal inference.

If you're ready to get started see :doc:`installation` and :doc:`usage`. If you'd like to learn more about the motivation and design of Maccabee, see the :doc:`design` page.
