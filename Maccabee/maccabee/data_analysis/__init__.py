"""The data analysis module contains the code responsible for calculating :term:`data metrics <data metric>` - metrics which quantify the location of a data set in the :term:`distributional problem space`. The module is not responsible for actually executing these calculations, that is handled by the :mod:`maccabee.benchmarking` module. Rather, this module is responsible for defining the actual metrics used to quantify the location of a data set on each :term:`distributional problem space axis`.

This module is split into two submodules. :mod:`~maccabee.data_analysis.data_metrics` contains the metric definitions and :mod:`~maccabee.data_analysis.data_analysis` contains the code which calculates these metrics given a :class:`maccabee.data_generation.generated_data_set.GeneratedDataSet` instance and  code which plots the calculated metric results.

.. note::

  For convenience, all the classes and functions that are split across the submodules below can be imported directly from the parent :mod:`maccabee.data_analysis` module.
