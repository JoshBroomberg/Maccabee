"""This module contains constants which are used throughout the package. The constants defined here serve two purposes: First, to simplify and standardize user interaction with the external APIs by providing users a convenient way to refer to common concepts/values. Second, to centralize the configuaration constants which control the internal operation of the package, giving more advanced users the ability to control/modify operation by making changes in one location.

All Maccabee constants are stored as attributes of the :class:`maccabee.constants.Constants` class. Within this class, constants are nested into subclasses of the ``ConstantGroup`` class (IE, the only attributes of the :class:`~maccabee.constants.Constants` class are ``ConstantGroup`` subclasses). These subclasses store actual parameters as their attributes. So, for example, the axis names for the axes of the :term:`distributional problem space` can be accessed as the attributes of the class ``Constants.AxisNames``.

All of the ``ConstantGroup`` classes can be introspected to view the constant names/values stored in the group. This is done by calling the ``.all()`` method which will return a name/value dictionary. If the ``print=True`` option is supplied this will (pretty) print the dictionary.

So, to access the axis name constants mentioned above, one first imports the constants class and then uses the ``AxisNames`` attribute. Because this attribute is a subclass of the ``ConstantGroup`` class, the ``all()`` method can be used to introspect the values.
